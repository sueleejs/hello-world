Finish the if-elif-else construct by replacing ___:
If dice is 1 or 2, you go one step down.

# Set the seed
np.random.seed(123)

# Generate and print random float
print(np.random.rand())

# Import numpy and set seed
import numpy as np
np.random.seed(123)

# Use randint() to simulate a dice
print(np.random.randint(1,7))

# Use randint() again
print(np.random.randint(1,7))
